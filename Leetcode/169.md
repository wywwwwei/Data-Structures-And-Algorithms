## 多数元素 Majority element

[toc]

Leetcode : [169.多数元素](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/majority-element/)

### 排序法

```c++
int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
   	return nums[nums.size()/2];
}
```

时间复杂度：O(Nlog(N))

空间复杂度：O(1)

### Boyer-Moore 投票算法

> This Method only works when we are given that majority element do exist in the array.
>
> The Moore voting algorithm is based on the fact that each time two different numbers are selected from the sequence and deleted (or called "offset"), the last number or several identical numbers remaining is the number of occurrences greater than half of the total number.

```c++
int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    int count = 0;
    int candidate = 0;
    for(auto num : nums){
        if(count == 0)candidate = num;
        if(candidate == num) count++;
        else count--;
    }
    return candidate;
}
```

时间复杂度：O(N)

控件复杂度：O(1)
