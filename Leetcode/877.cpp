/**
 * Because piles.length is even,
 * say the first, third, fifth, seventh, etc. piles are white, 
 * and the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, etc. piles are black.
 * 
 * Alex(the first hand) can always take either all white piles or all black piles, 
 * and one of the colors must have a sum number of stones larger than the other color.
 * 
 * Hence, Alex(the first hand) always wins the game.
